#Community, But Not Cluttered

> “We don’t need more features. We need better feelings.”

##Problem

Communities on X feel... noisy.  
Every one you join floods your home timeline.  
You lose control. You lose clarity.

Want to post? You’re unsure who sees it.  
Want to leave? It’s hard to even remember what you joined.  
Want to report a post? 5 screens later, you're frustrated.

And worst of all: the **good posts get buried**.  
No clarity. No hierarchy. Just more content.

##Insight

People don’t want a new community.  
They want **a quiet corner**.

Where:
- they can **post freely** — even anonymously.
- good content **bubbles up naturally**.
- filters, tags, and settings are **at their fingertips**.
- **joined communities don’t flood the feed** unless you want them to.

##The Redesign

We reimagined the X Community system:

- 📍 Turn off **auto-pin** when joining a new community
- 👻 Enable **anonymous posting** (“StayUNnoticed”)
- 📌 **Pin to Device**: 1-tap shortcut to your fav communities
- 🏷 **Tags on Timeline**: Filter without jumping between screens
- 🪪 Request-based **OFFICIAL TAGS** from verified partners
- 🔝 Smart **Ranking Algo**: `Rank = (Weighted Impressions + Engagement Score) / √Total Members`
- 📈 Clean insights for admins — alerts, analytics, recommendations and many many more

##Flow

Reporting a post now takes just 1 screen.  
Browsing feels focused. Posting feels safe.  
Discovering feels exciting — **not overwhelming**.

## 💭 The Feeling

> “It felt like this was always how Communities should’ve worked.”

That’s the goal.
