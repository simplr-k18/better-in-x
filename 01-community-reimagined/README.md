# Reimagining X Communities — The Human Way

> “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.”

## The Problem

Current social communities (Facebook Groups, Reddit Threads, even X Communities) often:
- Are **noisy**, with poor content discovery
- Feel **mechanical**, not human or emotional
- Offer little personalization or ownership
- Require **multiple steps** for basic actions like reporting or filtering

---

## The Idea

Redesign X Communities to:
- Feel like **home**, not just content
- Offer **anonymous, safe sharing**
- Let users **pin**, **filter**, and **rank** content intuitively
- Borrow best practices from Reddit, Discord, Pinterest, and mix with Jobs-level simplicity

---

## What I Did

- Designed and explained a **ranking algorithm** for quality posts  
  `Rank = T(Weighted Impressions + Engagement Score) / sqrt(Total Members)`
- Added features like:
  - 📌 Pin-to-home toggle for each community
  - 🫥 Anonymous posting (StayUNnoticed)
  - 📚 Bookmark filtering for better save organization
  - ⚙️ Personalized community settings
- Report flow now requires just 1 tap instead of 5
- Introduced **official tag partnerships** + shortcut filters on the main feed
